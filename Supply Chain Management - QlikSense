The objective of this project is to design and implement a Supply Chain Management (SCM) solution using Qlik Sense, a business intelligence and data visualization tool, and the DataCo dataset, which provides a comprehensive dataset of supply chain operations. The project aims to analyze and optimize the supply chain operations, identify areas of inefficiency, and provide actionable insights to improve supply chain performance. Real time monitoring of sales and orders, checking transaction mode, managing inventories and demand forecasting using historical data are main insights captured in this project.
